            "usage": "Beautiful smooth skin in just 5 steps: Apply the cream evenly to dry skin with the coloured side of the sponge. Do not massage in. Make sure that the hair you want to remove is completely covered with cream.Now wash your hands. Wait at least 2 minutes after application before entering the shower. Shower as usual. Try not to expose the applied cream to a direct stream of water for the first 2 minutes so that the cream can work long enough. It is quite normal that some of the cream is gradually washed off during this step. Leave the cream on the skin for a total of 4 minutes, then remove it with the white side of the sponge. If necessary, you can leave it on a little longer - but not longer than 6 minutes in total. Rinse off thoroughly.",
            "additionalInformation": "Do you like to spend a little time in the shower - maybe even practising your favourite song? You can use this time effectively to let our Veet depilatory cream work in the shower and declare war on annoying body hair. The kit contains a cream and a sponge. The coloured side of the sponge makes it easy to apply the cream in the shower (particularly effective for large areas such as arms and legs). Then simply leave on for 3 to 6 minutes and remove the cream with the white side of the sponge. This makes it easy to remove unwanted hair, even from hard-to-reach areas, without the risk of cutting yourself. The cream provides a long-lasting sensation of softness with a minimum of ingredients* *Compared to all previous Veet shower creams."
