            "additionalInformation": "Meridol Gentle White Toothpaste fights the bacterial causes of gingivitis and gently removes discolouration on the surface of the tooth. When gums become inflamed, it is usually due to the bacteria that settle at the gumline. However, these inflammations only occur when the bacterial plaque is not removed regularly or thoroughly enough. Discolouration of the teeth is also a possible consequence of this plaque. This is precisely where meridol Gentle White Toothpaste comes in: The unique combination of the active ingredients amine fluoride and stannous fluoride provides an immediate and long-lasting effect instead of just removing the symptoms. The medical formula fights the bacterial cause of gingivitis. The innovative formula works gently and effectively like a care balm, keeping gums hygienic and healthy. The natural whiteness of the teeth is also preserved. The gentle cleaning formula of meridol Gentle White Toothpaste removes unsightly stains and discolouration and gives you naturally white teeth. The double-action formula of meridol Gentle White Toothpaste provides an immediate and lasting antibacterial effect in the mouth, while thoroughly cleaning the teeth without attacking the tooth surface. Choose meridol Gentle White Toothpaste today and make your teeth and gums shine."
