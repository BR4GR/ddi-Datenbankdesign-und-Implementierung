Your well-being and appearance are the shining proof of this. Packed with the good qualities of the whole wheat of which they are made, Fitness cereals have a very low fat content. The calorie intake is thus regulated in a natural way already at breakfast, without having to forgo enjoyment. Fitness contains many nutrients that are important for your physical well-being. The high proportion of dietary fibers, naturally contained in whole grain wheat, causes a long-lasting feeling of satiety and at the same time ensures optimal digestion. Fitness also contains important vitamins, such as C and E, which have a beneficial effect on your appearance and well-being."
