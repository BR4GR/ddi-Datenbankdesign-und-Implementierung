        "usageInformation": {
            "usage": "FIELD OF APPLICATION - Ideal for small-area bonds. Glues almost all solid and flexible materials like ceramics, leather, rubber, many plastics (such as rigid PVC, ABS, PS, Plexiglas®, polycarbonate (Makrolon®), and phenolic resins (Bakelite®)), porcelain, metal, wood, cork,\nfelt, and cloth (check suitability first). Only partly suitable for glass (over a certain period of time the bond becomes brittle, causing it to weaken). Ideal for porous materials. Not suitable for PE, PP, silicone resins, PTFE, Styrofoam®, fabrics and leather clothing.\nAPPLICATION - Directions for use:\n1. To pierce the membrane, turn the cap clockwise firmly onto the tube. Tip: do not press the tube while piercing.\n2. Unscrew the cap to reveal the applicator. Apply the adhesive directly from the tube, using the nozzle, as thinly as possible onto one side (too much glue slows down the curing process significantly). Press parts together immediately. After use (if tube not yet\nempty), clean nozzle with a dry tissue and replace cap.\nStains/residue: Wipe off excess glue immediately with a dry cloth. After curing, glue residue is very difficult to remove. Acetone will dissolve glue but very slowly (check suitability first).\nAdvice: When glueing at low humidity, curing time can be shortened by briefly breathing onto one of the parts to be assembled. The best glueing results are reached at room temperature.\nSTORAGE CONDITIONS: Store in a dry, cool, frost-free place. Storage below +5 °C (in refrigerator) ensures maximum shelf life.",

If product comes into contact with the eyes, rinse immediately with plenty of water and seek medical advice. In case of contact with skin, glue can be dissolved by soaking in warm soapy water. Then apply a skin cream. May cause respiratory irritation. Avoid breathing vapours. Keep out of the reach of children.",
