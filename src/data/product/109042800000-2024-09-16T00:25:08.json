Feeding guide : Discover also Vital Balance high nutrition in delicious pouches to meet your cat’s tailored needs. Kibbles can be fed alone or in combination with Vital Balance WET. The recommended daily amounts should be adjusted to weather conditions, the cat’s level of activity and its physical condition. If you feed Vital Balance for the first time, we recommend to make the change gradually by replacing an increasing amount of your cat’s current food by Vital Balance for 7 days period to allow your cat’s digestive system to adapt to the change. Water facilitates the elimination of waste from the organism. The more your cat will drink, the more her urine will be diluted and less irritating, which will help limit the formation of urinary stones. Make sure to always leave a bowl of fresh and clean water at her disposal. To keep your cat in good health: - feed her with high quality food - encourage water consumption by always providing fresh drinking water - help your cat keep an ideal body weight by following the feeding guidelines and through regular physical activity, by playing with her - change her habits smoothly (such as a move or the arrival of a new pet) to avoid stressing your cat"
