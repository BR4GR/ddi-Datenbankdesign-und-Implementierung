            "additionalInformation": "Plenty's innovative Power-X™ structure keeps the kitchen roll strong and tear-resistant, while its soft cushions absorb extra well. This means that the household towels can absorb liquid thanks to the honeycomb technology and can even be wrung out - without tearing at all. It is suitable as a perfect helper for everyday kitchen use and is versatile in the household. With the household wipes from Plenty, any dirt and any stain can be removed in no time - whether on clothes, the kitchen shelf or the floor. The robust paper is suitable for wiping up, scrubbing, polishing and vacuuming without leaving any lint behind. Thanks to the optimised perforation, the individual cloths can be torn off very easily and no paper is wasted. Each roll is designed with trendy designs.\n\nPlenty household wipes are not only hygienic and practical, but also sustainable, as the packaging is 100% recyclable and reduces the carbon footprint** by using recycled plastic."
