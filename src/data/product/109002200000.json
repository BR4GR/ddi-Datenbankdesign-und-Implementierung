Just follow the feeding guide below with any irresistible flavour of your choice. Each kitten is different, depending on the kitten activity level and body condition, food amounts and/or time allowed to eat may need to be adjusted. Serve at room temperature – always provide clear fresh drinking water for your kitten to drink. Serve your kitten’s food in the same place every mealtime so he doesn’t get confused and don’t disturb him while he’s eating. FELIX Kitten is also suitable for sterilized cats. Feeding guidelines should be adapted to help maintain a lean body. FELIX Kitten is also suitable for pregnant or lactating mothers as they require energy-rich food too to take care of their kittens-to-be. After 12 months, your kitten is now an adult and ready to enjoy the delicious range of Felix Adult."
