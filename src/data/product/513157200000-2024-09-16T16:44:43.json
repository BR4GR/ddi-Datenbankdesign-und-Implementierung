            "usage": "Instructions for use: ACTIVATION TIME: MIN. 5 MIN. - MAX. 10 MIN. The depilatory cream is suitable for hair removal from the groin fold, pubic area, root of the penis, scrotum and buttocks. Do not use the depilatory cream on the body or tip of the penis, between the buttocks and around the anus. When using the product for the first time, we recommend shortening the hair by about 2 cm to facilitate application. 1) Spread the depilatory cream evenly over the skin with your hands or the rounded side of the spatula until all the hairs are covered. Then rinse your hands thoroughly with water. 2) Leave the depilatory cream on the skin for at least 5 minutes. Then test with the spatula on a small area to see if the hair is already coming off. If the hair comes off easily, remove the rest of the cream with the spatula or a damp flannel. If the hair is not yet removed, leave the cream on for a little longer - but not longer than 10 minutes in total. If you feel a burning or stinging sensation during application, remove the cream immediately with a damp washcloth and rinse the skin thoroughly with water. 3) Then apply the care balm as a moisturiser and gently massage it into the skin: Voilà!",
