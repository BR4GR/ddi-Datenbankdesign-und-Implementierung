A graded submission is part of the assessment for LE2 and LE3. This mini-challenge can be
submitted for this purpose. This mini-challenge may be handed in as a group of a maximum of 2
people. The grade achieved counts as a submission for both, LE2 and LE3.

### Task: Comparison of different database types

**Objective:** A solution with NoSQL and with SQL is compared on the basis of a specific problem.

Specify a problem that can reasonably implemented with a NoSQL database. The problem must
be non-trivial, i.e. it should contain at least one foreign key in SQL. Be it between two tables or
as a self-reference.

Select a NoSQL database that fits the problem. Determine the advantages of the chosen data-
base and how you can measure these advantages.

Design the conceptual data model and then implement it with the selected NoSQL database
and with a relational database. The implementation should be done in such a way that it is opti-
mised for the problem. This means that the logical and physical data model is adapted to the
query requirements.

Fill both databases with the same data.
Compare the two databases with the defined measurements.

### Report

Write a report in which you reflect the results and answer the following questions:

#### General questions

* What is your prior knowledge of databases from your previous practical experience?
* What was the most important insight for you?
* Are there any other important points that had an important influence on your learning success?

#### Specific questions

* Which NoSQL database did you choose and why?
* What does the problem look like?
* What does the conceptual data model look like?
* What does the implementation in the two databases look like?
* What advantages did you expect from the NoSQL database?
* What measurement criteria did you define?
* What do the measurement results look like?
* Interpret and reflect on these measurement results.

### What we expect

The report as a document (Word or PDF-format), containing the conceptual model (hand-draft
or created with a tool). The scripts for creating the databases and loading the data (SQL and
NoSQL) as separate text file(s).

### Criteria for grading

In the report (containing up to 20 pages, text and figures) all questions are answered in a cohe-
rent, well-founded and understandable way.
